# GenomeTools

The GenomeTools genome analysis system is a free collection of bioinformatics
tools (in the realm of genome informatics) combined into a single binary named
`gt`. It is based on a C library named `libgenometools` which contains a wide
variety of classes for efficient and convenient implementation of sequence and
annotation processing software.

### [Platforms](#platforms)

GenomeTools has been designed to run on every POSIX compliant UNIX system, for
example, Linux, Mac OS X, and OpenBSD.

### [Building and Installation](#build-install)

Debian (testing) and Ubuntu (raring and later) users can install the most recent
stable version simply using apt, e.g.
```bash
% apt-get install genometools
```
to install the `gt` executable. To install the library and development headers,
use
```bash
% apt-get install libgenometools0 libgenometools0-dev
```
instead.

[Source tarballs](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/releases) are
available from GitHub. For instructions on how to build the source by yourself,
have a look at the
[INSTALL](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/blob/master/INSTALL) file.
In many cases (e.g. on a 64-bit Linux system) something like
```bash
$ make -j4 64bit=yes
```
should suffice. On 32-bit systems, omit the `64bit=yes` option. Add `cairo=no`
or `curses=no` if you do not have the Cairo or Curses libraries and their
development headers installed. This will, however, remove *AnnotationSketch*
support from the resulting binary. When your binary is built, use the `install`
target and `prefix` option to install the compiled binary on your system. Make
sure you repeat all the options from the original `make` run. So
```bash
$ make -j4 64bit=yes install prefix=~/gt
```
would install the software in the `gt` subdirectory in the current user's home
directory. If no `prefix` option is given, the software will be installed
system-wide (requires root access).

### [Contributing](#contributing)

GenomeTools uses a [collective code construction
contract](http://genometools.org/contract.html) for contributions (and the
[process](http://genometools.org/contribute.html) explains how to submit a
patch). Basically, just fork this repository on GitHub, start hacking on your
own feature branch and submit a pull request when you are ready. Our recommended
coding style is explained in the
[developer's guide](http://genometools.org/documents/devguide.pdf) (among other
technical guidelines).

To report a bug, ask a question, or suggest new features, use the
[GenomeTools issue tracker](https://github.com/genometools/genometools/issues).
